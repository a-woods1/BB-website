      <h2>If you're going to run a marathon, make sure you take the last few weeks off.</h2>
      <p>It may sound counterintuitive, but the concept of “tapering” is a critical part of marathon training. Tapering is the idea of reducing your training in the last few weeks, in order to make you stronger, mentally and physically, for the big day.</p>
      <p>Our team has been doing our own version of “tapering” this week, using our time together to <b>refuel, reflect, and re-energize</b> for our marathon summer ahead: </p>
      <h2>Refuel: How can we quickly acclimate to a new culture?</h2>
      <p>This summer we’re thrilled to be working on site with our Bloomberg clients in their New York City office. This has involved new apartments, new work culture and new work technology (including the intimidatingly efficient Bloomberg Terminal). Although we were already familiar with Bloomberg’s work culture from our Spring semester research, inhabiting the space on an ongoing basis has already felt different, and will hopefully lead us to even more insights about how Bloomberg works.</p>

      <div class="photo_caption">Jinping in our new office space -- slightly better view than our room in Pittsburgh!</div>
      <p>We made some cards to keep in our room that any team member can “play” at any time to ensure we are living these habits:</p>

          <p><b>Ask three questions</b></p>
          <p>When offering criticism, we will commit to asking at least three questions. This will not only help us better understand the thinking behind the criticism, but also allow us to be more generative.</p>

          <p><b>The QIE triangle</b></p>
          <p>When making key decisions, surface the tension between Q (quality), I (inclusion) and E(efficiency). Using this card ensures we think about the current balance of all three elements.</p>

          <p><b>Use the whiteboard</b></p>
          <p>When decision making/discussion has become a verbal back and forth, use this card to get everyone to draw their ideas at the whiteboard so we can all visualize what we are thinking.</p>

          <p><b>Individual - Group - Individual</b></p>
          <p>This card helps facilitate better working sessions by going through a individual - group - individual process, which gives individuals time to digest information before reaching a team agreement.</p>

          <p>When two ideas/hypotheticals are in conflict, use this card to get both parties to create something with elements of both (in Sketch, on the whiteboard, in slides, etc)</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>We will continue to treat team issues like design problems, and invest more time up front to set us up for greater success later on.</p>
      <h2>Re-energize: how will we move forward with our current design prompt?</h2>
      <p>Our team had a great discussion (at the whiteboard!) to confirm our focus for the semester.</p>
      <p>Our goal: To support people with disabilities to disclose what they need to get hired and perform in Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Questions involved in the disclosure experience currently include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why - what is the purpose of disclosing my disability?</li>
        <li>Who - who should I disclose to?</li>
        <li>When - when is disclosure necessary? </li>
        <li>How - how should I disclose?</li>
        <li><b>Whether  - should I disclose at all?</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Among these questions, the team finds disrupting “whether to disclose” as the most interesting, as it involves giving more power to the person with a disability. We want to help people with disabilities make a more informed decision during their own disclosure experience. Some current measures of success for us will be making people with disabilities feel supported, eliminating surprises, and removing uncertainty during the disclosure experience.</p>
      <p>From our Spring research, we also know there are a variety of factors that could make a person more or less likely to disclose a disability, which may be useful design considerations or constraints. Our team represented these factors using a visual model:</p>
      <img class="blog_photo" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/images/placeholder.png') }}" alt="Placeholder image"/>
      <p>After considering the factors above our team realized we still need to make several decisions to narrow our scope (e.g. should we focus on people with visible or invisible disabilities?). However, we can still start prototyping right away! In fact, we think our designs will be able to help us make some of these scoping decisions later on. Another commitment for us this semester will be more making and research by design, and we hope you will help hold us to that.</p>
      <p>See you next week at the starting line!</p>

                <div class="blog_quote">Looking back lets you know whether or not you are headed in the right direction. -- G.K. Adams</div>
                <h2>No one wants to get stuck in the past.</h2>
                <p>However, in the words of G.K. Adams, sometimes it's necessary to find the right path ahead. This week, our team took Adams’ message to heart, as we worked toward a final design concept.</p>
                <h2>Looking back</h2>
                <p>By the end of spring semester, our team had developed two valuable pieces of work:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>A service blueprint that captured numerous data points from our onsite research at Bloomberg on the hiring and onboarding process</li>
                  <li>Three design concepts tested with people with disabilities</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This week was our chance to look back at all of the data--from the service blueprint, testing notes, and other external research--under the new lens of disclosure. From these sources, we synthesized over 40 data points and 20 breakdowns in the current disclosure experience.</p>
                <p>One of the key breakdowns we identified relates to work performance. People with non-obvious disabilities may not disclose out of fear that if they do they will not get a job or promotion. However, sometimes this means that they do not get what they need to be successful. They end up not getting the job or promotion because of perceived performance issues.</p>
                <img class="blog_photo" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/images/placeholder.png') }}" alt="Placeholder image"/>
                <div class="photo_caption">A simple model of the current and potential future state of this breakdown. We recognize that in reality the emotions involved are extremely complex.</div>
                <div>The key need we decided to address is the idea that people with non-obvious disabilities need to better understand the risk/benefits of disclosure. ​<b>How might we communicate the value of disclosure and/or minimize the risk?</b></div>
                <h2>Moving forward</h2>
                <p>We had our prompt. Now we were ready to ideate!</p>
                <p>Our team spent about six hours total coming up with different ideas, and tried a couple of new techniques from previous sessions to really spark creative fireworks.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><b>External design inspiration.​</b> Two team members researched examples of design from analogous domains and presented them to the rest of the team. We also kept these examples up during later ideation sessions. These examples ranged from the ​<a class="team_links" href="https://gizmodo.com/is-the-dominos-pizza-tracker-telling-the-truth-1642997792">Domino's</a> pizza tracker​ (a great example of forecasting long-term value) to marketing examples of ​<a class="team_links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">anchoring</a>.</li>
                  <li><b>Round robin technique.</b> Each person developed a design feature, and then passed it around to other team members who would add on comments/features, etc. This created a more “yes, and!” atmosphere.</li>
                </ol>
                <img class="blog_photo" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/images/placeholder.png') }}" alt="Placeholder image"/>
                <div class="photo_caption">An example from our Round Robin ideation. Can you guess the handwriting?</div>
                <p>From about 40 potential features, we were able to narrow them down to five prototypes to build and test the following week. First, by clustering similar features together into concepts, and then by assessing each concept according to three metrics:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Do we believe this concept addresses our original need statement? (1-5)</li>
                  <li>Does this concept address Bloomberg’s key needs? (1-5)</li>
                  <li>Is this concept in the realm of technical feasibility? (1-5)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We are also adding to our participant pool with a variety of new associations and resources in the NYC area. We’re excited to see what goes well when we present these to people and, perhaps more importantly, what goes wrong, so we can make sure we’re moving in the right direction.</p>

Through recruiting and interviewing users and conducting secondary research, we came to the end of our first summer sprint with a focused need to guide us through the rest of the project.</p>
